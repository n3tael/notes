## Developing

Once you've cloned this project and installed dependencies with `bun install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
bun dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
